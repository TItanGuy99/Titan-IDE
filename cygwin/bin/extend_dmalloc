# Use this Perl script to run gdb and get information on the return-address
# (ra) addresses from a dmalloc logfile output.  This will search for
# any ra= lines and will examine them and try to get the line number.
#
# NOTE: you may want to direct the output from the script to a file
# else gdb seems to prompt for a return like you are on the end of a
# page.
#
# Be sure to send me mail if there is an easier way to do all this.
