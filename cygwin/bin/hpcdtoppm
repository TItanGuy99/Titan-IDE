You are running a program named 'hpcdtoppm' that stands in for the real
program by that name.

The real 'hpcdtoppm' is a program that converts an image from Photo CD format
to PPM format.  The program you are running now just issues the message you
are reading.

Please get a copy of Hpcdtoppm from 

  http://terasaur.org/item/show/hpcdtoppm-netpbm-convert-photo-cd/4967

and replace this stand-in program with the real one.

The point of this is that this stand-in 'hpcdtoppm' is distributed with Netpbm
on Sourceforge.  Hpcdtoppm does not meet the requirements to be distributed on
Sourceforge because a copyright holder does not permit people to sell copies.
At one time, the real Hpcdtoppm was distributed with Netpbm on Sourceforge by
mistake.
