# Backport the last change in HEAD, to a branch.
# Usage: svnbackport [-b branch] <file> [<file> ...]
#
# This is a port of the "cvsbackport" script:
# Initial author: Dirk Mueller
# Support for multiple command-line arguments, handling of patch rejects: David Faure
# Ported to SVN: Till Gerken
# Options and quote-safety: Matthew Woehlke
#
# This isn't the most sophisticated script ever, and might break. It needs to be
# used from within the repository so that it can guess the remote URL correctly.
