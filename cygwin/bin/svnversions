=head1 NAME

svnversions -- Displays version of the files passed as argument.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    svnversions <file1> [<file2> [...]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

svnversions displays the last revision a file in Subversion was
changed, as known by the local checked out directory. No connection is
required to the Subversion server. It is equivalent to the "COMMITTED"
revision name.

Unlike svnversion(1), this program returns the revision a file was
modified. svnversion(1) tells the revision a working dir is at.

It can be used in other scripts, or simply to ask for diffs using

svn diff -r [<version>:]<version> <file(s)>
