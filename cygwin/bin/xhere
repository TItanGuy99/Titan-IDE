#!/bin/bash
# Have to use bash; can't get ash to "exec -l"
# Separate script from chere to avoid need for argument parsing
#
# first arg is shell
# second arg is the path

VERSION=1.4
# HISTORY PRIOR TO GIT
#VERSION=1.2
# Add support for dash
# Add support for mksh
#VERSION=0.7
# Run normally if /bin is not in path
#   Thanks to Dave Griffin
# Don't complain if second arg not present. Assume we are in the correct
#   directory. This allows compatibility with previous versions of chere.
#VERSION=0.6
# Fix a couple typos
# cd to second arg to handle invocation from RH explorer pane
# If the second arg is not a valid directory, guess a network path since
#  we will always lose the \\ prefix
#VERSION=0.4
# First version, tied into chere version

# Would have the second arg as a directory to cd to, but the directory
# can't be quoted correctly for netork paths

# Fully specify paths to binaries, as /bin is not necessarily in the path
